# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This project is a simple, visually appealing Lotto Number Generator web application. It allows users to generate six unique random numbers between 1 and 45 with a single button click. The application is built using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean user interface and a smooth user experience.

## Project Details

### Style & Design

*   **Layout:** Centered, responsive container using Flexbox.
*   **Color Palette:** A gradient background from a deep blue (`#667eea`) to a purplish tone (`#764ba2`), with white text and vibrant red accents (`#ff6b6b`) for the button.
*   **Typography:** 'Poppins' font from Google Fonts for a clean and modern look.
*   **Effects:**
    *   A "glassmorphism" effect on the main container using `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`.
    *   Subtle box-shadows on elements to create depth.
    *   Smooth transitions and a `translateY` effect on the button for interaction feedback.
*   **Components:**
    *   Circular divs to display the generated numbers, giving it a lottery ball feel.

### Features

*   **Random Number Generation:** Generates 6 unique numbers from 1 to 45.
*   **Interactive Button:** A clear call-to-action button to trigger the number generation.
*   **Dynamic Display:** The generated numbers are dynamically inserted into the designated number divs on the page.
